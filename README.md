# Data-Mining-on-Terrorism-Database
Analysis done on a terrorism database. One attribute was found out to be the target which was "cause of the attack". The target had missing values. The main aim was to predict the missing values using the known data. k-nearest neighbors was used along with word embedding for the textual data.

To Run:
Run TerrorismAnalysis file first which generates a .bin file which will then be used in knnTerrorism file.
So run that after the former.
